/**
  * @note 'Amplitude' is the value of an attribute at its peak. A 'Lambda', or time-coefficient,
  governs the rate of change in an exponential function - it is called lambda by analogy to 
  physical processes with exponential functions (ie Radioactive Decay). The former is assigned on 
  a per-attribute basis (i.e. a seperate gene for each attribute's Amplitude). The latter appears 
  to be global for all attributes - using a single 'age_rate' double. Also note that 'Amplitudes' 
  are integer values, while 'Lambdas' are rational (a smaller fraction indicates a slower aging 
  process - greater than 1 and the creature has the life-expectancy of a mayfly).

  * @note getHealth returns the Monster's health at the instant it is called. A creature whose 
  instantaneous health is greater than 0 is 'alive' and may perform actions. A creature whose 
  instantaneous health is less than or equal to 0 has died of natural causes. A creature's health 
  at any instant is given by 2-e^(\lambda t). \lambda is the coefficient of decay, a smaller 
  (fractional) value indicates that the creature will age more slowly. t is the time in days. 
  The natural lifespan of a creature should be given by t = ln(2)/\lambda. A creature's Health can be 
  reduced by Injuries - bringing about an earlier demise.

  @note Strength, Evasion and Toughness are calculated from an 'Amplitude' coefficient (determining 
  their peak value) and a 'Lambda' time coefficient determining the time it takes to reach that peak, 
  and how fast the creature 'decays' from that peak. The amplitude is called 'a' and the time coefficient 
  is called 'lambda'. These three attributes are given by a[e^(\lambda t)-1][2-e^(\lambda t)]. Noting that 
  \lambda is the age_rate field and a is the 'Amplitude' for that characteristic.

  @note Appendix A of the Requirements Specification includes the functions dealing with reproduction and 
  fertility - they are not reproduced here for space concerns.
